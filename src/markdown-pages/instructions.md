### How to use
This app was made to assist users in training their memory.
The memory system used was taken from Tony Buzan's Master Your Memory book;
he calls it the 'Major System Code'.

The idea is to establish distinct words for each number from 0-99 that you can
use to associate with random information.

For example, if I had a list of ten items to remember,
I could associate each of those items with a word that I had already committed to memory for each
of the numbers 0-9 (or 1-10 if you preferred). If the tenth item was a lawn-mower, and my memory system
used 'dice' as my word for number 10, I could imagine some crazy (the sillier, ruder or crazier the better) story
that involved dice with a lawn-mower.

When it comes to recalling the tenth item, I immediately summon 'dice' and then
that leads me to my imaginary scene involving the dice and the lawnmower.
### Where do I start
The problem is that this system requires us to remember 100 words before we can begin to use it.
However, there is a system to remember the system.

The first thing you need to do is go to the [Number Sounds page](/number-sounds) to learn the sounds (not necessarily the letters) that are associated with each number from 0-9.
If you expand the panels for each number, a suggestion is given about how to remember each one.

Once you have remembered
a sound for each number, you can combine them, fill in between the consonants with any appropriate vowels, and create a word.

Earlier we used 'dice' as the word for 10. We arrived at this because 1 has a 'd' or 't' sound and 0 has a 's', 'z' or soft 'c' sound.
So we can combine those sounds and try to make words that make sense, preferably a noun (as it is easier to make an image of in your story).
Following this logic we come up with 'dice'. It could also have been 'doze' or 'toss'. You need to pick one that you think works best for you.

Once you have remembered all the sounds for the numbers, go to the [Setup page](/setup) where you can pick a default from a suggested list of words for each number,
or you can add your own.

Once you have changed the defaults of numbers 0-99, you can go to the [Matrix page](/matrix) and test yourself.
Basically look at each number and see if you know what word you have associated with it. Then, press that number and see if you were correct.
### Device/browser consistency
This app doesn't require login and doesn't use cookies. This makes it simpler, it doesn't need a server and no data protection
issues arise because no data is taken.

The downside of that is that if you customise the words, or select a word other than the
default from the suggestions, these changes will only be saved on the device/browser that you made the changes on.
If you open the app in a different browser or on a different device, your changes will not be there.
