## Memory Matrix

I wanted to make a simple app so that I could experiment with React hooks. I had been teaching my son a memory technique explained by Tony Buzan in his book 'Master Your Memory'; I decided to make an app to help revise this memory technique.

I deployed it to Netlify: [Memory Matrix](https://infallible-montalcini-1165e0.netlify.com)

I didn't style it with desktop in mind, it is styled for mobile devices. I may revisit it later to improve the desktop experience, but the main aim here was to explore react hooks.
